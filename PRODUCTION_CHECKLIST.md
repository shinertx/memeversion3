## üöÄ Production Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Environment Preparation
```bash
# Run production readiness check
./scripts/production_readiness_check.sh

# Review and customize configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your specific configuration
```

### Phase 2: System Deployment
```bash
# Automated production build and deployment
./scripts/production_build_and_run.sh
```

### Phase 3: Health Monitoring
```bash
# Start real-time health monitoring
./scripts/production_health_monitor.sh
```

## üîí Safety Features

### Multi-Layer Risk Protection
1. **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic trading halts based on drawdown
2. **Paper Trading Mode**: Safe testing environment (default)
3. **Position Limits**: Configurable per-trade and global limits
4. **Stop Losses**: Portfolio-wide and trailing stop loss protection

### Data Integrity
1. **Input Validation**: All market data validated before processing
2. **Event Ordering**: Redis streams ensure proper event sequencing
3. **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation when services fail
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for system health issues

### Security Controls
1. **Credential Isolation**: Private keys stored in isolated signer service
2. **Network Segmentation**: Services communicate via internal Docker network
3. **Access Control**: No external access to sensitive services
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all trading decisions and executions

## üìä Key Metrics to Monitor

### System Health
- Service availability (all services up and responding)
- Redis stream health (events flowing, no excessive backlog)
- Database performance (connection pool, query times)
- Memory and disk usage (< 80% utilization)

### Trading Performance
- Strategy generation rate (new strategies per hour)
- Trade execution success rate (> 95%)
- Circuit breaker status (should be "Normal" most of the time)
- Portfolio drawdown (should stay within configured limits)

### Risk Management
- Active trade count vs. limits
- Portfolio value vs. stop loss thresholds
- Position sizing compliance
- Circuit breaker activation frequency

## üö® Alert Thresholds

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Action Required)
- Circuit breaker activation at Warning level or higher
- Any service down for > 5 minutes
- Database connection failures
- Memory usage > 90%
- Disk usage > 85%

### Warning Alerts (Monitor Closely)
- Redis stream backlog > 1000 events
- Trade execution success rate < 98%
- Strategy generation stopped
- Network connectivity issues

## üß™ Testing Procedure

### 1. Paper Trading Validation (Required)
- Run system for minimum 24 hours in paper trading mode
- Verify all strategies generate signals
- Confirm portfolio manager allocates capital correctly
- Test circuit breaker at each risk level

### 2. Load Testing
- Generate high-frequency market data events
- Verify system handles 1000+ events per second
- Confirm database performance under load
- Test service recovery after restart

### 3. Failure Scenarios
- Test Redis connectivity failure
- Test database connection loss
- Test individual service failures
- Verify graceful degradation

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Throughput
- Market Data Events: 1000+ events/second
- Strategy Evaluation: 50+ strategies/minute
- Trade Execution: Sub-second latency
- Database Operations: < 100ms average

### Resource Requirements
- Memory: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- CPU: 4 cores minimum for production load
- Disk: 20GB minimum, SSD recommended
- Network: 100Mbps for external API calls

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Services Not Starting
1. Check port availability: `netstat -tulpn | grep :8080`
2. Verify Docker daemon: `systemctl status docker`
3. Check resource availability: `free -h && df -h`
4. Review logs: `docker compose logs <service_name>`

#### Database Connection Issues
1. Verify Postgres health: `docker compose exec postgres pg_isready`
2. Check connection string in .env
3. Verify network connectivity between services
4. Review database logs: `docker compose logs postgres`

#### Redis Stream Issues
1. Check Redis connectivity: `docker compose exec redis redis-cli ping`
2. Monitor stream lengths: `docker compose exec redis redis-cli xlen events:price`
3. Check for Redis memory issues
4. Verify producer/consumer balance

#### Trading Issues
1. Verify paper trading mode is enabled initially
2. Check circuit breaker status
3. Verify wallet file accessibility
4. Review executor logs for trade attempts

## üìû Support & Escalation

### Log Collection
```bash
# Collect comprehensive logs for analysis
docker compose logs > system_logs.txt
docker compose ps > service_status.txt
free -h && df -h > resource_usage.txt
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
# Performance metrics collection
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=up > prometheus_metrics.txt
docker stats --no-stream > container_stats.txt
```

This production-grade deployment has been thoroughly tested and hardened for live trading environments. All critical code paths have been audited and secured against common failure modes.
